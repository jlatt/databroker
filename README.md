`DataBroker` is a library for organizing functional units of Javascript into a robust and (potentially) testable program. It borrows conceptually from [reactive programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming), but without the requirement to write in a special (read: non-Javascript) language. It is intended for use in browser-based apps, but is currently presented as a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) application for ease of distribution.

I am abandoning this project in favor of [frp.js](https://github.com/jlatt/frp.js).
